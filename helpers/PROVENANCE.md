# Automatic Claims helper

`vendor/connectcoin_p2c_tools` contains the MIT-licensed, independent TLS 1.3
P2C implementation from [connectcoin-p2c-tools](https://github.com/connectcoincrypto/connectcoin-p2c-tools),
commit `ad35a58a0c59ed985b3566d352053773269e76d2` (0.3.0). The CLI and tests
are not required at runtime. The upstream license is retained alongside it.
ConnectWallet's local hardening in `generator.py` also rejects multicast,
reserved and IPv6 translation/tunnel destinations: `is_global` by itself is
not a sufficient SSRF boundary. Local patches also add independently cancellable
capture sockets and completion telemetry. Capture success means completion
through CertificateVerify before certificate verification and the hash-target
test, as in Core. The protocol-3 desktop service emits a capture event before
verification, then one terminal result per request. The main process retains
the last 100 completed observations per domain and exact signature-policy mask.
DNS failures and cancelled queued attempts do not create TLS observations.
The legacy one-shot generator retains bounded snapshots for development tooling;
it is not the desktop scheduling path. Proof encoding and verification are unchanged.

`p2c_roots_v1.pem` is the immutable Mozilla-derived consensus trust bundle from
ConnectCoin Core. Its SHA-256 is
`f66dff1bdf8f96060b8177976f8b7d9254bc89bc4db933d769f7384d28480bc9`.
The provider verifies this pin before connecting. Do not refresh it with the
operating system's current roots: a new consensus bundle requires a new version.
The bundle's source and attribution are in its header.

The bridge accepts only a prepared claim's public context. It never accepts a
mnemonic, private key, wallet password, cookie, or RPC credentials. A proof is
bound to the **spending transaction ID**, not the bounty's funding transaction
ID. Validation uses the chain's median time past supplied by the main process.
The main process independently checks the funding transaction and builds the
claim before starting this helper. An unencrypted, untrusted RPC is not SPV;
the helper does not prove that the advertised chain is the canonical chain.

The helper uses TLS 1.3 with ephemeral X25519 keys from the cryptographic
provider and OS-backed random session IDs (`secrets.token_bytes`). Connections
are restricted to public IPs after DNS resolution, and DNS results are pinned
for each job. The TLS port is always 443. No HTTP requests are sent. Every
returned result passes work, domain, pinned-root certificate path, output
signature-mask, challenge, and CertificateVerify verification. This independent
X.509 implementation can reject some encodings accepted by Core; the node's
consensus validation remains authoritative.

The desktop uses one persistent helper/executor shared across all bounties,
defaulting to 100 starts/sec and 100 simultaneous TLS connections (maximum 256
of either). Each connection has a 10-second deadline; there is no 1,000-attempt
or 180-second batch limit. DNS resolution uses two bounded slots, a 60-second
positive cache and 2-second negative cache. The cache holds at most 4,096 domains
with 32 pinned endpoints each, and the total pending-request limit is 512.
The helper independently enforces Core's exact successful-capture budget:
stop starting attempts once `successes * (target + 1) > 2^257`, including successful
captures whose hash misses. Already in-flight captures may still finish. A
bounded 1,024-entry counter cache never evicts active/queued bounties; the main
process supplies its retained uint64 counter on every request. No private-network
or unpinned-root bypass is available. Automatic Claims remain opt-in. Individual
cancellation closes only that attempt's socket. Cancellable TLS receives also
check cancellation using receive polls of up to 100 ms, including partial record headers and
bodies: cross-thread socket closure alone does not reliably wake macOS receives.
These polls share the original absolute handshake deadline; they do not extend
it. Wallet lock/stop terminates the entire helper. OS DNS calls cannot be interrupted by Python, so process termination
remains the hard shutdown bound for a stuck resolver. Input/output frames are
limited to 16/160 KiB and concurrent output is serialized.

For development, run `node scripts/setup-claims.mjs`. It creates a private
Python virtual environment and installs the pinned provider. Python 3.11+
must already be installed. This is a local setup operation, never an automatic
download triggered by a remote bounty. For desktop packaging, run
`node scripts/setup-claims.mjs --build` on each target OS. The resulting
`helpers/bin/connectwallet-claims/` directory must be copied unchanged into Electron's
external resources (not inside ASAR). Its launcher is `connectwallet-claims.exe` on
Windows and `connectwallet-claims` on macOS/Linux. A user-created source installation
can use the virtual environment instead.

The build copies original Python, provider, CFFI, parser and bootloader notices
into `_internal/licenses/dependencies`. It includes the installed provider's
SBOMs and obtains the original OpenSSL notices from version-tagged upstream
sources. Rust dependency license archives are checked against the exact crate
SHA-256 checksums in the provider's SBOM; their text is retained unchanged.
`manifest.json` records the provenance and hash of each copied notice. A fresh
packaging build therefore needs Internet access for these license sources;
the resulting desktop helper does not download them at runtime.

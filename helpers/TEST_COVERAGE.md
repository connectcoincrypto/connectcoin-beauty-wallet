# Automatic Claims verification boundary

The offline Python tests run a controlled loopback TLS 1.3 server with a
temporary test CA. The real capture implementation obtains its handshake;
the independent verifier checks its CertificateVerify signature, certificate
path, DNS name, challenge and work target. Altered challenges, signatures,
targets, signature policies and the production-root pin are rejected.
The custom CA exception exists only in the test's direct verifier call, not
in `claims_bridge.py` or the wallet's production worker.

Offline telemetry tests cover completion order under concurrency, rolling
100-entry snapshots and monotonic completion counts, successful captures that
miss the work target or fail later certificate verification, queued cancellation,
DNS failure, and in-flight completions after a winning proof. A 100,000-attempt
simulation verifies the once-per-second output limit and bounded NDJSON size.
These scheduler tests mock public capture calls and send no public traffic.

Persistent protocol-3 tests cover startup/shutdown, strict framing/IDs/options,
DNS caching/expiry and endpoint rotation, global start-rate/concurrency limits,
per-attempt cancellation, completion-before-verification ordering, exact uint64
successful-capture budgets and their strict two-expected-value boundary, and
bounded pending/DNS/counter caches. A 1,100-capture simulation verifies that one
executor survives across all bounties without a 1,000-attempt lifetime cap. A
second loopback fixture verifies that cancellation interrupts a real blocked
socket receive rather than waiting for the handshake deadline.

The independent native Core regtest checks ConnectWallet's typed transaction wire
encoding, native Schnorr payments, P2C funding and the spending transaction's
exact challenge. Wallet service tests exercise complete bounty snapshots,
journal catch-up, reorg/window cleanup, preparation, cancellation and broadcast
failure handling using controlled RPC responses.

**An entire successful TLS proof claim accepted by the unmodified Core daemon
has not been verified end-to-end offline.** Core uses its immutable public CA
bundle in regtest too. Our generated test CA is deliberately not in that bundle.
Core's `VerifyP2CCertificateProofForTest` permits test roots only as a C++ unit
test API; it is not a runtime RPC or regtest switch. A recorded public proof
also cannot be reused for an arbitrary local claim: ClientHello is bound to
that spending transaction's ID and input index.

A positive daemon-level test requires an authorized TLS endpoint with a
certificate chaining to the pinned public roots, or an explicitly separate
test-only consensus harness. Neither production root enforcement nor the Core
daemon was modified to manufacture a passing test. These checks are not an
independent security audit or evidence of mainnet readiness.
